Aam Aadmi Party today targeted the Delhi Police saying it was wasting its energy by leveling "false charges" against party lawmakers and that the credibility of the force is under question owing to rising incidents of crime in the city.
Addressing a press conference, AAP Delhi Convenor Dilip Pandey cited the arrest of a constable for allegedly gang-raping a woman in Ranhola area of West Delhi on Thursday night in countering the assault charges against party MLA Commando Surinder Singh.
"How would anyone feel secure in this city when men who are supposedly protectors end up committing such crimes? It's all because the police is busy cooking up false charges against our MLAs," Mr Pandey said.
Mr Pandey blamed the police of conspiracy against the public and said that "the trust deficit or the credibility crisis is purely because of the fact that police continue to work under the Narendra Modi government, adding that it should "focus on women's security instead, otherwise it stands discredited."
