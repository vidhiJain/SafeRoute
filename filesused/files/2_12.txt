A man was seriously injured after he and his driver were shot by two policemen in Greater Noida in Uttar Pradesh over a minor dispute.
Rajkumar Rathi and Jaspal Singh, the two cops, were allegedly drunk when they stopped the car of Jay Prakash Pandey, a Home Ministry employee and asked for the vehicle's documents.
Witnesses say a minor squabble then turned ugly when the cops shot the man also injuring his driver in the process.
Doctors had to remove a part of Mr Pandey's right arm to stop the risk of spreading infection and both he and his driver are still in the hospital.
"My brother was returning from a birthday party late at night with his driver when the police stopped him and asked him for the papers. I don't know what happened next but they shot him in the arm," a relative said.
Police have arrested the two accused cops and begun an investigation.
In an attempt to cover up the incident the policemen had also tried to blame the incident on two local private guards who were present nearby.
