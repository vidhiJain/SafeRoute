Against the backdrop of rape and other crimes, Prime Minister Manmohan 
Singh today favoured putting in place institutional mechanisms to ensure
 safety and security of women and children.
Addressing a conference of top police brass of the country, Dr Singh said the tragic rape and murder of a young girl in Delhi last December not only brought into sharp focus the issue of women's safety but also the rising expectations of the people from the police in preventing such crimes. 
"We have recently enacted several laws providing stringent punishment for such crimes and more sensitive treatment of victims during investigation and trial.
"We also need to put in place other institutional mechanisms to ensure the safety and security of women and children. I expect the DGPs of states to show leadership in this area," he said.
The Prime Minister, however, did not elaborate what the institutional mechanism would be.
The comments come in the midst of the raging controversy over the alleged sexual assault on a woman colleague by Tehelka founder Tarun Tejpal.
After the December 16 incident, the government had amended various provisions of law and strengthened those related to crime against women and children.
