A girl studying in Class 11 at a school in Delhi was stabbed to death on Thursday, allegedly for registering a molestation complaint.
The 19-year-old was stabbed nearly seven-eight times when she had gone to the market near the Anand Parbat area in West Delhi. Her mother was also injured while trying to save her, a police officer told news agency IANS.
Both the girl and her mother were taken to the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, where the teenager died from her injuries, police said.
The teenage girl's family alleges the girl was killed by their neighbour Jaiprakash, his brother and their mother, because she had registered a molestation complaint against Jaiprakash in 2013.
The police have arrested Jaiprakash and are also questioning his family.
