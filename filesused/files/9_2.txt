Australia has updated a travel advisory to its citizens visiting India, asking them to continue to exercise a high degree of caution because of the risk of terrorism, civil unrest, crime and vehicle accidents.
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) issued an advisory on March 14, 2013, saying "It contains new information under Summary and Safety and Security: Terrorism." 
It said, "We continue to recommend Australians to exercise a high degree of caution in India overall because of the risk of terrorism, civil unrest, crime and vehicle accidents." 
"Possible targets include public places in New Delhi, Mumbai and other major cities, and Indian security and political interests. Major secular and religious holidays could provide terrorist groups an opportunity or pretext to stage an attack," the advisory said.
Citing the March 13 terror attack on a police camp in the Benima area of Srinagar, the advisory said: "If you are in Srinagar, you should follow the instructions of local authorities and monitor local media." 
However, the overall advice for Jammu and Kashmir and north eastern parts of India was similar to the past ones.
It advised travellers to reconsider their travel plans for the north-eastern states of Assam, Nagaland, Tripura and Manipur because of the risk of armed robbery, kidnapping, extortion and terrorism-related incidents.
While for Jammu and Kashmir it said, "We advise you to exercise a high degree of caution in the Ladakh region of the state of Jammu and Kashmir and to reconsider your need to travel to the cities of Jammu and Srinagar (including the Jammu-Srinagar highway).
"We advise you not to travel to other parts of the state of Jammu and Kashmir, due to frequent armed clashes, terrorist activities and violent demonstrations."
