Victims of cyber offences can now report their cases and seek technical help at zero cost at the first private cyber crime reporting helpline which has become operational in Delhi-NCR.
Rampant crime over cyberspace and inability of the police in dealing with such cases have led to the setting up of this helpline.
Through the helpline number launched last month, the reporting centre has received around 250 complaints in 15 days.
Of the total complaints, 130 pertained to cases of financial fraud mostly phishing, and around 80 cases of outraging modesty of women through social networking sites, said a source in the Indian Cyber Army, developer of the helpline and consultant to Delhi Police and their counterparts in three other states.
Among the cases pursued in the first 15 days, most clients did not report the matter to the police - despite being suggested - once their problems were solved, the source said.
"However, eight particular complaints - six cases of phishing and two cases in connection with social network sites - were forwarded to Delhi Police and the investigators have progressed well in the probes," said a Crime Branch official.
The concept of the cyber helpline was borrowed from that of the Internet Crime Complaint Centre (IC3.gov) operated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), said a developer connected with the helpline.
"For both social networking and financial frauds, the protocol is simple - contact the intermediary (banks in case of financial fraud cases and concerned sites for social networking) and communicate the complaint, provide ID proof and transaction details, and reverse the transaction/delete obscene contents," he said.
