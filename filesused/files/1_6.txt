Two persons, including a senior citizen, were allegedly shot at before being robbed of cash in two separate incidents which took place within two hours in northeast Delhi on Monday.
In the first incident, which took place around 9 am, a 70-year-old man was allegedly shot at by robbers who made away with Rs 3 lakh cash he was carrying, said a police official.
The victim, Jagbir Singh, who works for a cooking gas supplier, was heading towards office in Gokulpuri with an associate when the robbers waylaid them. When the man tried to resist, they allegedly fired two rounds, of which one bullet hit the elderly man's leg, and fled with the bag containing the cash, said the official.
In the second incident, which took place around 11 AM, a man identified as Rajbir Singh was heading towards Gandhi Nagar from his residence in Maujpur, when two bike-borne persons waylaid him midway and tried to snatch his bag containing around Rs 10 lakh cash, which Singh was going to deposit in a bank, said a police official.
When he tried to resist, the robbers allegedly fired and the bullet hit his arm, following which Mr Singh collapsed on the ground and the robbers fled with the case, the official said.
The victims in both the cases are admitted in a hospital and their conditions are reported to be stable. Cases have been registered and separate teams have been constituted to investigate both the cases, a senior official said.
