All of them had injuries caused by sharp objects.
Police got a call about the incident around 8:30 PM following which senior officials rushed to the spot.
"There was no ransacking of the house and robbery doesn't seem to be the motive. Personal enmity seems to be the motive given the way children have been killed," a police officer said.
Crime and forensic teams lifted circumstancial evidence from the spot. Police has registered a case of murder and further investigations are on.
