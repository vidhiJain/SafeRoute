The Crime Branch of Delhi Police has taken up investigation into the alleged sting operation done by Aam Aadmi Party which purportedly showed BJP state unit vice-president Sher Singh Dagar offering bribe to AAP MLA for switching side.
Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) Ravindra Yadav confirmed that the Crime Branch is investigating the case. He, however, clarified that no FIR has been registered in this connection.
Although Mr Yadav refused to divulge much details about the nature of the probe, he said, "Whatever is needed will be done."
A delegation of the AAP led by party chief Arvind Kejriwal had on Thursday met Delhi Police Commissioner B S Bassi and demanded Dagar's arrest.
Mr Bassi had then referred the case to Crime Branch. 
In a letter written to Mr Bassi, AAP legislator from Sangam Vihar, Dinesh Mohaniya, who the party had claimed was offered a bribe of Rs 4 crore by Dagar, demanded that an FIR be registered in the case and a thorough investigation be conducted.
"An FIR should be registered in the case and Sher Singh Dagar should be immediately arrested for offering bribe. The police should also investigate who is the high command Mr Dagar is seen talking about in the sting. The high command should also be arrested," the letter had said.
Mr Kejriwal had also submitted a video copy of the "sting". After the alleged sting operation, the BJP had issued a show-cause notice to Mr Dagar and sought his response in this matter.Â
