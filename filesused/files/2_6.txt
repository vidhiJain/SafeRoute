The Delhi assembly on Monday adopted a resolution to set up a three-member panel to probe the alleged police inaction in cases of crime against women.
The move comes in the wake of the brutal murder of a 19-year-old girl, Meenakshi, in broad daylight in Anand Parbat area of the city. The AAP government accused Delhi Police of "inaction" in the case.
The resolution was tabled by Delhi Women and Child Minister Sandeep Kumar. The commission of inquiry will be chaired by a retired judge.
The resolution will add to the acrimony between the Delhi Police and the AAP government of Delhi.
