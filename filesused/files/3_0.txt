A 20-year-old man was allegedly stabbed to death by a street vendor after he refused to pay him Rs 20 for a soft drink in south Delhi's Malviya Nagar area.
The incident took place yesterday afternoon when the victim, identified as Sunil Kumar, had gone to buy soft drink with his friend at BTR Corridor near Chirag Dilli.
"The duo had four glasses of drink, each costing Rs 5. However, Sunil allegedly refused to pay the vendor for the drink. A heated argument ensued and the vendor, identified as Deepak, whipped out a knife and stabbed Sunil in his abdomen and fled the scene," said a police official.
The victim's friend informed the police by calling them on PCR (Police Control Room). A police team rushed to the spot and took Sunil to the hospital where doctors declared him brought dead.
Meanwhile, the accused has been arrested by the police. "Deepak (40) was arrested from his house at Khirki Extension. We have also recovered the knife used in the commission of the crime. A case of murder has been registered," he added.
Sunil, who lived with his parents in Panchsheel in Delhi, was pursuing Bachelor of Arts, police said.
