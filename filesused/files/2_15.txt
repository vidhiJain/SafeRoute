In a case of double murder, a 92-year-old retired engineer and his 64-year-old daughter-in-law were found stabbed to death at their residence in central Delhi's Patel Nagar this evening.
Â 
According to police, bodies of Sewa Ram and daughter-in-law Sasi were found around 6 PM by his son Sudhir. The incident came to light when Sudhir, who works as an
insurance agent, returned home and found the door locked from inside. He told the cops that he made several attempts to contact his wife after the house bell went unanswered.
"Sudhir then called his sister who stays nearby. They opened the door using a duplicate key and spotted the bodies in a pool of blood," a police official said.
While Ram was found lying on the bed, Sasi's body was discovered on the floor of her bedroom, he said, adding that both of them had suffered multiple stab wounds.
Though details of the motive behind the double murder as well as the perpetrators of the crime were not yet clear, cops are suspecting the role of an insider. "The house was not ransacked... even valuables and jewellery were not taken away. We have registered a case of murder and started our probe," a senior officer said, adding, the bodies have been sent for autopsy.
Preliminary investigations suggest that the entry to the house was friendly and the assailant might have used a back door to escape.
Police are also probing property angle as the house was owned by Ram and his son Sudhir.
