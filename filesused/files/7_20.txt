A garment manufacturer was today shot in the stomach while he was in his car by two men on a motorcycle outside a bank in the national capital.
Vivek Sood, 46, had stopped his car outside the Punjab National Bank in south Delhi's Kalkaji area this afternoon, where he was going to deposit Rs 3 lakh. 
But before he could step out of his Maruti SX4, two men on a motorcycle came next to him and knocked on the car's window.
When Mr Sood rolled down the window, they tried to snatch the bag in which he was carrying the cash. Even though Mr Sood threw the bag out of the car, the motorcycle-borne assailants still shot him in the stomach and fled with the money.
Mr Sood was rushed to a hospital where his condition is being described as stable. 
The police, meanwhile, have launched a search for the two attackers.
