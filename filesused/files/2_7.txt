Hours after water cannons were used to quell a protest by the youth wing of his Aam Aadmi Party against the police on Sunday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to hand over the control of Delhi Police to his government.
The AAP protest, held outside the Delhi Police headquarters, was against the alleged inaction of the police in the gruesome murder of a 19-year-old girl in central Delhi last week. The teen had been stabbed 35 times in North-west Delhi's Anand Parbat for protesting against harassment.
"I request Prime Minister Narendra Modi with folded hands that the control of the Delhi Police be handed over to us. He has to run the whole country," Mr Kejriwal said at a function in Delhi's Peeragarhi relief camp. "I am not saying Delhi Police officials are wrong. They are very good people and are working but the system is bad."
The Chief Minister has already written to police chief BS Bassi, asking for a meeting on Monday to discuss the law and order situation, reported news agency Press Trust of India, quoting a senior government official.
Mr Kejriwal ordered a magisterial probe into the murder and on the occasion, had criticised the Delhi Police for the "deteriorating" law and order situation.
"The Chief Minister and his deputy Manish Sisodia had yesterday visited the girl's residence, where people told them that there was no police patrolling in the area and apparently some policemen were also involved," the official was quoted as saying.
AAP has been demanding for some time that the control of the Delhi Police -- which is under the administrative control of Home Ministry -- be brought under the Delhi government. It is one of the key issues on which Mr Kejriwal's demand for full statehood for Delhi hinges.
Mr Bassi said the party has been at loggerheads with the police. "They stepped up attack after the arrest of its two MLAs," he was quoted as saying.
