On the second anniversary of December 16 gang-rape incident, Delhi Lt Governor Najeeb Jung today said several steps have been taken to ensure women security in the national capital but there is still a need for social awareness in the society to bring an end to such cases.
"Delhi was ashamed when this incident took place and it continues to feel ashamed. We have taken lesson from it. We have opened women cell at every police station and have also increased the number of CCTVs in view of women security.
"Trauma Centres are also being built at hospitals," Jung told reporters on the sidelines of an award function for Delhi University lecturers.
The LG said if girls in the national capital still feel unsafe, it was not due to steps not being taken to ensure women security but because there is a need for change in mindset and social awareness in the society.
"Girls continue to feel unsafe, but it doesn't mean that steps have not been taken to ensure women security. The response time of PCR vans has decreased and it is now just 3-4 minutes. 181 helpline has also been started," he said.
"The important fact is that we should bring social awareness in the society. We need to find out the reason why men behave in such manner in Delhi and we should also ask this question to ourselves. Administration cannot do things beyond a limit...it mostly depends on the society," he added.
A 23-year-old physiotherapy intern was gang-raped, and brutally sexually assaulted by six men, including a juvenile, in a moving bus on December 16, 2012. The accused then threw her and her male companion out of the vehicle, to die by the roadside on the cold December night.
