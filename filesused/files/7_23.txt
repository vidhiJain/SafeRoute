A 17-year-old boy was stabbed to death in the national capital by his four friends over a trivial issue, the police said on Saturday.
Ravi, who was reported missing, was on Friday found murdered near a mall in Mayur Vihar in east Delhi, police said.
According to a police officer, Ravi was missing from his house after he went out to meet his friends on Thursday.
When Ravi's parents approached police the next day with a complaint that their son was missing, the investigators showed them a body which they had recovered. Ravi's family identified the body, police said.
Ravi was on Thursday called by his friends for consuming liquor but an argument broke out between them over a trivial issue and he was stabbed to death with a broken bottle of beer, police said.
The victim's friends disfigured his face with a heavy stone so that the body could not be identified, police official said.
"We nabbed all the four accused, who live in the same area, on Friday night," said a police officer.
