CCTV cameras will be installed at vulnerable points within the jurisdiction of 44 police stations where the crime graph against women is higher, Delhi Police told the high court today.
A division bench of Justice BD Ahmed and Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva took on record the affidavit filed by additional commissioner of police (legal cell) and posted the matter for March 25.
"In the first phase, the CCTV cameras would be installed at the vulnerable points within the jurisdiction of these 44 police stations identified on the basis of crime mapping study, where the graph of crime against women is on the higher side in these police stations. The remaining areas shall be taken up in next phases thereafter," the affidavit said.
Seeking a month's time to install CCTV cameras in the jurisdiction of 44 police stations, police said the district deputy commissioners of police have been directed to forward their proposals containing the requirements of CCTV cameras in their respective districts/units by March 20, 2015.
"On receipts of proposals for the installation of CCTV cameras as well as its locations, the specific sites will be got surveyed through professional government agencies with regard to the technical support ie night vision, resolution of cameras, pixel strength, vulnerability of pilferage, network to control rooms, zoom facility etc."
The affidavit added: "After finalisation of the technical specification of the CCTV cameras, consolidated proposal will be forwarded to ministry of home affairs for obtaining permission of the competent authority for which one month more time is required."
The bench had earlier asked Delhi Police to formulate an action plan to put up CCTV cameras in Delhi for the safety of women as per crime mapping exercise after an advocate Meera Bhatia asked it not to remove CCTV cameras which were installed during the visit of US President Barack Obama in January.
The court has been monitoring women's safety in the national capital after it took suo motu cognizance of the December 16, 2012, gang rape incident.
