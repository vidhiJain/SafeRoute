Three thousand women will join Delhi Police by next year as part of the government's efforts to strengthen the capital's police force to deal with crime, especially against women.
The women - both officers and constables - will be deployed in each of the capital's 166 police stations and handle sensitive cases related to the fairer sex.
"Recruitment of the women is going on. After that they will undergo a massive training. Hopefully, all of them will join the Delhi Police rank by the end of next year," a Home Ministry official said.
Delhi Police is under the administrative control of the Home Ministry.
All the posts were sanctioned in the aftermath of the December 16, 2012 gangrape of a woman in the capital.
As part of the plan announced then, at least two women sub-inspectors and seven women constables will be part of the staff in every police station across the capital.
Delhi Police is hiring the women under a special drive to recruit women in the force.
The strength of Delhi Police is around 80,000 personnel, of which around 7,000 are women.
Justice J S Verma Committee and Justice Usha Mehra Commission, which were appointed after the brutal gangrape incident, suggested various measures for reforms in the legal and police apparatus. They have also suggested strengthening of the women component of Delhi Police.
Some of the women police personnel will be sent for 'advanced training' on investigation of rape cases, handling a woman victim, following guidelines and collecting evidence in such cases.
The training would be imparted by judges, lawyers and other experts as well as Non-Governmental Organsiations, the official said.Â
