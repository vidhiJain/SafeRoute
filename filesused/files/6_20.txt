Thirty-three inmates of a juvenile home in north-west Delhi escaped last night, police said, adding that 14 of them were arrested this morning.
The incident happened at Seva Kutir, a juvenile home in Mukherjee Nagar area in north-west Delhi.
"At 8:30 pm yesterday, around 58 juveniles went up to the home's terrace where they started shouting, burnt mattresses and pelted stones. They also tampered with a few cylinders because of which gas leaked," said police.
Later, they broke doors and damaged property inside the home. Thirty-three of them managed to flee outside from the terrace.
Fourteen of them were apprehended by the police this morning, while the rest are still missing. The boys are in the age group of 15-17 years old, the police said.
