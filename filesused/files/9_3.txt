In a suspected case of murder, a 53-year-old electronics engineer was today found dead under mysterious circumstances in a park in north-east Delhi. 
The incident was reported from Dilshad Garden and the deceased has been identified as Bharat Bhushan, police said.
Bhushan had gone for an evening walk yesterday but did not return home. The family approached police after a passerby spotted the body and informed investigators. 
"There were injury marks on his body. We have registered a case of murder. We are probing all angles-from robbery to personal enmity," a senior police official said.
Bhushan is the cousin of AIIMS Medical Superintendent D K Sharma.
