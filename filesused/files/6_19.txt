Sending a strong message, the Delhi Police today dismissed two of its constables for attempting to sexually assault a young girl.
"Constables Amit Tomar and Gurjinder Singh have been dismissed to send a
 strong signal, that harshest measures will be taken even against police
 personnel if found guilty of abusing women, children and weaker 
sections," a press release by the Delhi Police said.
"Delhi police reiterates its resolve to come down heavily as per law 
against all those who indulge in perpetration of any crime against 
women, children and weaker sections of society irrespective of the 
victim's affiliation to any position of dominance or otherwise - more 
so, if they do happen to be donning the uniform which is for protection 
of rights of every citizen and never the contrary," the statement added.
The victim was roaming near Vikaspuri police lines with two other girls, when constable Amit Tomar lured them to his colleague Gurjinder Singh's residence with the promise of money. There, both the cops tried to force themselves on the young girl.
On hearing the girl's cries, the two other girls who had been picked up also started crying for help.
Someone from the vicinity called up the PCR and the girls were rescued.
The police has promised that a chargesheet will be filed within one week. AÂ  Special Investigation Team has also been formed to probe the incident.
This incident comes just a day after we reported how a Station House Officer (SHO) of a local police station made a 13-year-old gang-rape survivor strip and touched her inappropriately when she went to complain. He had allegedly asked the minor to "show" how she was raped. He was suspended pending inquiry. (
