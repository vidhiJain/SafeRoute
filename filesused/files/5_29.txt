A Delhi court has sentenced a man to 20 years in prison for raping a seven-year-old child, saying the society expects the perpetrator of this crime to be dealt with sternly.
Additional Sessions Judge Virender Bhat also slapped a fine of Rs.45,000 on Anil Kumar, 19, observing the convict's crime is intensely grave and serious in nature as the child did not even know the names of human sex organs, and would not have realised or understood while being raped.
"The society looks upon the crime with utmost indignation and abhorrence and expects the perpetrator of this crime to be dealt with sternly," said the judge in an order whose details were released late Saturday.
Terming rape the most hated crime, he said: "Not only does it affect the physique and psychology of the victim, but has an impact upon the society as a whole."
Justice Bhat, while turning down the convict's plea for leniency, said the court cannot ignore the impact of the crime and society's expectations while dealing with such criminals.
Kumar sought leniency saying he has no past criminal antecedents, and has to look after his ailing mother.
"The age of the convict or his family background do not impress me and do not persuade me to take any lenient view in favour of the convict," the judge said.
The court said that it is difficult to imagine the intense mental trauma and torture the victim must have suffered, and added that people found guilty of raping minor girls do not deserve any leniency or mercy.
Police lodged a complaint against Kumar in April 2012 under various charges dealing with kidnapping, and raping a minor.
