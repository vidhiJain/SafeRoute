An elderly man and his 50-year-old daughter were found dead under mysterious circumstances in their house in north Delhi's Sarai Rohilla area on Thursday.
They have been identified as Hari Kishan Verma (88), a retired teacher, and Rajbala, who after separating from her husband was living with her father, police said.
A senior police officer said "it appears to be a case of murder but the exact cause of their death could only be ascertained after autopsy."
"However, the bodies bear no injury marks. Also, no valuable in the house is missing," he said.
Mr Verma's two sons and his grandson have been arrested in connection with the murder.
Police said that Mr Verma was engaged in a property dispute with his sons. He had also filed a case against them in 2009.
