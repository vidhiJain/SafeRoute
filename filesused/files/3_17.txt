The body of a 40-year-old woman was recovered this morning from a DDA nursery in south Delhi's Vasant Kunj area in New Delhi, with the police suspecting that she was killed after being gang raped.
 
The incident came to light today morning, when a security guard informed the police about the body.
 
"Right now, it looks like a case of murder, and we registering a case under Section 302. The woman has been identified as a resident of Fatehpurberi. Rest of the details will be given after the postmortem," said Deputy Commissioner of Police Prem Nath.
The woman had left from home yesterday morning around 9:30 am for work. However, when she did not return till late evening her family members launched a search and also informed the police.
 
The woman was the only earning member of her family, after her security guard husband met with an accident last March. She has three daughters, between 15 and 9 years of age. She had joined a factory, where she did embroidery work, about two months back.
 
Her daughters said she had been escorted home at about 10 pm on Thursday by a man sent by the head tailor of the factory, who had then called her to enquire if she had reached safely. The girls said their mother had argued with the head tailor, but did not know about what. 
 
When she had not returned home by 10 pm last night, they went to the factory with their father, looking for her, but met with little success. They learnt that her body had been found, when they received a call from the police in the morning.
 
Earlier, police officials had said that the woman's body had been found in the bushes of the nursery with her hands and legs tied while her clothes were in a disheveled condition. "Prima facie, it seems that she was killed after being gang raped. But, the exact cause of death and whether she was sexually assaulted or not will be clear only after postmortem," the police official added, saying further investigations are on.
