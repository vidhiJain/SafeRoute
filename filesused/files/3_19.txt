The Delhi Police today interrogated Congress leader Shashi Tharoor's domestic help for several hours in the murder investigation launched three days ago into the death of Mr Tharoor's wife, 
.
The Press Trust of India reports that Narayan Singh, who was in Himachal Pradesh, traveled to Delhi today to meet with the police. Mr Tharoor is at an ayurvedic hospital in Kerala; he is expected to end his 14-day treatment there tomorrow, according to staffers at the clinic. (

"Mr Singh was interrogated at an undisclosed location in South Delhi," said the news agency. In a letter written to Delhi Police Chief BS Bassi in November, Mr Tharoor had alleged that his domestic help had been assaulted during interrogation and pressured to "confess" that along with the politician, he had killed Ms Pushkar. The 51-year-old was found dead a year ago at a five-star hotel in Delhi after publicly accusing Mr Tharoor of having an extra-marital affair with a Pakistani journalist. (

The Police Chief has denied Mr Tharoor's accusations of attempts to frame him and has indicated that the politician is among those who will be questioned. The murder case does not name any suspect. (

An explanation for why a murder case has been lodged so much after Ms Pushkar's death, the police chief cited new facts in the latest medical report submitted by doctors at Delhi's AIIMS hospital, where the post-mortem was conducted. He did not elaborate on the new evidence, but said that Ms Pushkar was killed by poison that was either given orally or injected. (
