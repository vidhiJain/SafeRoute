In the past three years, five minor girls were allegedly raped in every two days, totalling around 46 per cent of the total rape cases reported in the national capital in the corresponding period.
"In 2013, 1,636 rape cases were reported in Delhi of which, in 757 cases victims were minors. In 2014, 2,166 rape cases were reported in which 1,004 pertained to minors.
"Till October 31 this year, as many as 1,856 rape cases have been reported and in 824 cases, the victims are reported to be below 18 years," Rajya Sabha was told today.
However, the Union Home Ministry maintained that Delhi Police, as a conscious policy of "truthful reporting", is registering complaints in the recent years with an objective that no crime, especially crime against the vulnerable groups, including women, goes unreported.
"During 2014, the work-out percentage of rape cases in Delhi was as high as 80.79 per cent. Similarly, during the current year (upto October 31, 2015) it is 77.16 per cent," the Rajya Sabha was told.
"Crimes like rape are handled with great sensitivity and various measures have been taken by Delhi Police for the safety of women in the city. Emphasis is given to ensure that all cases of crime against women are investigated by women officers.
"Delhi Police has organized self-defence training programmes in which 17,699 girls and women were imparted training during the year 2014," said Minister of State for Home Affairs Haribhai Parathibhai Chaudhary.
