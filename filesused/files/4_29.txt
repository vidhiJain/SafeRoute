The year 2013 witnessed theft of valuables worth Rs 13,219 crore, second highest of the decade, as per the data by the National Crime Records Bureau. The amount recorded is the second highest in the last decade. However, the recovery percentage rate by the police was second lowest.
The police was able to recover stolen articles worth only 1,762 crore from all over the country during the period. A senior police officer said that the value has gone high mainly because of the increase in prices of various products over the years.
"Value of articles have gone up drastically over the decade. The highest number of share in the stolen articles is of vehicles. In Delhi where the number of vehicles equals to that of total number of vehicles in Kolkata, Chennai and Mumbai, 30 per cent of stolen articles are vehicles," the officer said.
