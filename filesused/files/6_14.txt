Crime Branch will conduct further investigation into the death of 24-year-old NRI student Anmol Sarna under mysterious circumstances following an alleged drug party with friends, Delhi Police told a court.
The police's response came after the family of Anmol had accused Delhi Police of shielding his four friends and framing two security guards in his murder and demanded the case be investigated by the Crime Branch.
Anmol, who had completed his high school from New York, was to return to Canada for further studies but died under mysterious circumstances after a drug party on the intervening night of September 13 and 14 organised at one of his friend's flat at South Park Apartment in Kalkaji area.
The court also extended the judicial custody of two accused Surender Bali and Naresh Mishra till October 28. Both were deployed as security guards at an apartment in Kalkaji where Anmol was injured. They were arrested for allegedly assaulting Anmol leading to his death.
Anmol's friends, accused Madhav Bhandari, Pranil Shah, Shivank Gambhir and Ritham Girhotra, all in their 20s, are presently out of jail on interim bail till October 22.
The four have to surrender before the court on expiry of their 15 days interim bail.
