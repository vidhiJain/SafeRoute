A man has been jailed for seven years for robbing a woman at knife point by a Delhi court which observed that day light robberies are increasing and need to be curbed.
Additional Sessions Judge Ravinder Dudeja awarded the jail term to 25-year-old Jai Kishan and also imposed a fine of Rs 5,000 on him.
"Day light robberies are on an increase making it unsafe for people to roam around. They need to be curbed. Legislature has provided minimum sentence of seven years under Section 397 (Robbery with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt) of the IPC.
"There is no reason why the convict should be sentenced for a period lesser than the minimum provided by the Act. Hence, considering the totality of facts and circumstances, convict is sentenced with seven years rigorous imprisonment with fine of Rs 5000 under Section 392 (robbery) read with Section 397 IPC," the court said.
According to the prosecution, the incident took in the afternoon in May 2012 when the woman was doing some work outside her house. Kishan came there and snatched her gold chain at knife point and tried to run away.
Victim Shabnam raised an alarm and Kishan was caught by the passers-by and he was beaten by them.
Police was called and broken pieces of the chain were also recovered from his possession.
During the trial, Kishan claimed that he was falsely implicated in the case as a minor scuffle had taken place between him and the woman's family a few days back.
The court, however, said he failed to prove his defence.
