Police Commissioner BS Bassi said that in addition to the measures taken by the force, every woman in Delhi would be trained in self-defence.
"We appeal to everyone to join hands with us so that every woman in Delhi gets trained in self-defence. I want every woman to have a brown belt in judo," said Mr Bassi at the Delhi Police's annual press conference.
"For this we also plan to conduct mapping of Delhi so that we can choose the areas from where the women will be trained," he added.
Police data also revealed that 2,069 cases of rape were registered in 2014 compared to 1,571 cases in 2013.

Mr Bassi also emphasized on the fact that to reduce the number of crime against women, the "mindset of the society" needs to be changed.
