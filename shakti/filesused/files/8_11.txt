Drunk driving is a punishable crime, but can passengers on Delhi's Metro be hauled up for riding drunk? Well, DMRC or Delhi Metro Rail Corporation certainly seems to think so. Earlier this week, Delhi Metro authorities proposed that passengers be subject to breath-analyser tests and not be allowed to ride if the tests revealed they had consumed alcohol. 
The DMRC's reasoned that a ban on drunken passengers would prevent brawls and make the Metro safer. But, the Delhi Police objected to the Metro's drive and said disallowing passengers who have consumed alcohol on the Metro will only lead to them taking to the wheels and thus increase instances of road accidents. 
Delhi's citizens were not amused at the DMRC's plans either. "Can't drive, can't take the Metro... How else will we travel?" one commuter NDTV spoke to asked.
DMRC has since toned down its plans. You will not be denied a Metro ride if you are down a peg or two, but random breath-tests will stay to monitor whether passengers have been drinking beyond permissible limits. If yes, then they will not be allowed to board the Metro. So, if you plan to drink and ride, then mind the gap between binge drinking and responsible drinking.
