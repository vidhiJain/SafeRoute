Shiv Kumar Yadav, the Uber driver who has been arrested for allegedly raping a young woman, does not appear to show any remorse about his crime, said one of the police officers interrogating him.
 
Yadav, who was arrested from Mathura on Saturday, was produced today before a Delhi court, which remanded him in police custody for questioning for three days. (Read:

Yadav had allegedly raped the 27-year-old woman, who had dozed off in his car on her way home to Inderlok. In her complaint to the police, she said she woke up to find the man molesting her. She said he even threatened her, saying if she approached the police, he would shove an iron rod inside her - a chilling reminder of the Delhi bus gangrape case of December 16, 2012.
 
During questioning, Yadav said when he found the woman asleep, he drove on and parked the car 4 km ahead of her house, near the Najafgarh drain, the officer said. When the woman awoke, Yadav admitted that he had grabbed her by the throat and even threatened to shove an iron rod inside her unless she kept quiet, he added.
 
Yadav had been booked in a rape case three years ago as well. According to the case lodged by the police in December 2011, he had raped the woman passenger - a 22-year-old who worked in a Gurgaon pub - at knifepoint, after taking her to at an isolated spot. (

He spent seven months in jail. He was reportedly acquitted, the police said, though the details remain unclear.
 
This time, he was arrested after a two-day manhunt from Mathura. The rape survivor, who had hired the car from Uber - a popular app through which people hire cabs - had taken a photo of the number plate when Yadav finally pushed her out of the car. 
Though he had turned off the cellphone that had the Uber app and the GPS installed, the police managed to track him through the two other cellphones he was using.
