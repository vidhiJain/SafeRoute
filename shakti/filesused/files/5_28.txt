There has been a 43.6 percent increase in Delhi's crime graph in 2013 over 2012, Police Commissioner BS Bassi said on Friday.
A total of 73,958 cases were registered in 2013, up from 51,479 in the previous year.
"Strict instructions have been given to police stations that each and every complaint be registered and not to turn away people," Mr Bassi told the media. "This is why (the number of) cases has increased."
