A Delhi Police sub-inspector allegedly shot dead a 28-year-old woman and then shot himself at a park in southwest Delhi's Dwarka this morning.
The policeman died hours after shooting himself, reported news agency ANI.
The officer allegedly had an extra-marital affair with the woman, who lived in Dwarka and had separated from her husband, said a senior police official.
The inspector was an accused in a domestic violence case that was registered after a complaint filed by his wife in Rajasthan, the official added.
According to the police, the incident took place around 9.45 am. The two were reportedly talking to each other when the inspector suddenly pulled out his service revolver and fired three bullets at the woman.
He then turned the gun towards himself and fired two rounds. Both were rushed to a nearby hospital, where the woman was declared dead. The inspector was in a critical condition and was taken to AIIMS' Trauma Centre, but later died.
The policeman joined the force as a sub-inspector in 2008 and is presently posted at west Delhi's Ranhoula police station. He reportedly knew the woman for the past three years.
