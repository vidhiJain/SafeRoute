A kindergarten teacher has been arrested in Ghaziabad, near Delhi, for allegedly beating up a 6-year-old student with an iron ruler for not finishing his homework.
Â 
Police said they have arrested Joshna Nigam, who had been working with Krishna Public school in Vijay Nagar for last eight months, for beating up a lower kindergarten student. 
She has been booked under section 323 of the Indian Penal Code for "voluntarily causing injury" and Uttar Pradesh's child protection laws. Offences registered under section 323 are non-cognizable. 
The family of the boy had filed a police complaint after he came home with contusions all over his back and hips on Saturday. 
Parents said the child was under shock when he reached home and had to be coaxed into telling what had happened and said he was beaten by teacher with iron ruler all over his back and shoulders. 
The mother of the child said that when she went to school after the incident she was told by the teacher that her son was beaten for not doing his homework and would be beaten again if he fails to do his homework.
After she was arrested the teacher admitted her mistake and said, "I was shocked when I realized what I had done."
"I did not beat him a rod, I beat him with a stick. I can't say anything more than that," she said. 
The family got a medical examination of the child done and have handed over the medical report to the police. 
The school has expressed regret over the incident.
