A gunbattle is on between the police and a gang of robbers in Ghaziabad near Delhi.
The police have surrounded a sugarcane field where the suspects are hiding after robbing a businessman. Two of the men have been caught and a policeman has reportedly been shot.
Visuals showed policemen in bulletproof gear armed with guns and rifles, searching the field. A policeman was positioned on a rooftop.
The suspects allegedly robbed the businessman in Meerut before escaping in a Maruti Swift car to Ghaziabad, about 45 km away.
When a police team chasing the car stopped it, the men allegedly opened fire. They then abandoned the car and ran into the fields.
About a dozen policemen are searching the area.
