A 17-year-old girl was shot in her neck by two unidentified men inside her house in Dakshinpuri in southeast Delhi on Tuesday evening.
The girl has been admitted to the Max Hospital in Saket. Her condition is said to be critical due to blood loss.
Two men on a motorcycle had arrived at the teenager's house and asked for her. They then entered the house and fired at the 17-year-old with a country-made pistol. 
After firing at the girl, they fled on their motorcycle. 
A jilted lover or personal enmity could be the reason behind the shooting, police said. 
A case of attempt to murder under section 307 of the Indian Penal Code, Arms Act and other sections has been registered and a probe is on.
