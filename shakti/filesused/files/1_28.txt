With the arrest of three persons, including a Nigerian national, the Crime Branch of Delhi Police have recovered heroin worth around Rs 7 crore in the international market, police said today.
The accused have been identified as Farhad (39), Paulinus Asochukwu (34) and Jabbar (60). The police recovered around 1.5 kg heroin from their possession on Sunday, said Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) Ravindra Yadav.
While Farhad and the Nigerian national, Paulinus, were arrested on September 13, Jabbar was arrested two days later.
Farhad was to allegedly deliver the consignment to Paulinus, following instructions of Jabbar, the official said.
"Jabbar was nabbed by the Narcotics Control Bureau earlier but he was released on bail in December 2008. However, on September 7, the Delhi High Court had ordered him to surrender. But Jabbar had some other plans and he was planning to leave the country," said Mr Yadav.
According to the police, Farhad and Jabbar were both born in Afghanisthan, but they are settled in Delhi since many years. While Farhad is married to an Afghan woman in Delhi, Jabbar's family migrated to Pakistan.
Farhad was allegedly lured into the drugs business by Jabbar, who used to procure heroin from Rajasthan.
Paulinus came to India in 2014 and came in contact with one Victor Bola G of Nigeria, who lured him into the business.
On September 13, Paulinus had come to collect the consignment from Farhad under Victor's direction.
However, police are yet to track Victor.
