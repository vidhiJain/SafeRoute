The Delhi Police on Friday put out names of all sexual offenders who have been convicted from 1983 onwards on its website. The list, put up by the crime branch, has over 600 names on it.
Police says it is an exercise to name and shame sexual offenders.
Delhi is often referred to as the rape capital of India. While 572 rapes were reported in the national capital in 2011, the number rose to 706 in 2012, as per data from National Crime Records Bureau.
The list has come out on a day an inquiry against a juvenile accused in the gang-rape of a 23-year-old physiotherapy student got concluded. A juveniles' court will hand down the verdict next week, which will be a first in the fatal gang-rape case.
The teenager, aged 17 at the time of the crime, was one of six suspects arrested after a physiotherapy trainee and her male friend were assaulted on a moving bus with an iron rod before she was raped. She died in a Singapore hospital two weeks later.
The case provoked mass protests across the nation and new laws to punish crimes against women.
