A 25-year-old youth has been arrested for allegedly trying to extort Rs five lakh from his uncle, who is an associate professor with the Delhi University, by posing as a gangster, police said today.
The accused, identified as Atish Ranjan alias Trilochan Kumar alias Sumit was arrested by the Crime Branch of Delhi Police after it received a tip off that he will be coming to Mehrauli Badarpur Road.
It was found that Ranjan is the nephew of Suman Verma, an associate professor in the Mathematics department of the Delhi University who had registered a complaint at the Maurice Nagar Police Station last year saying that he had been getting extortion calls.
"During interrogation, Ranjan revealed that it was he who had been making extortion calls to his uncle and demanding Rs five lakh, as he was in dire economic distress while his uncle was financially sound," said Additional Commissioner of Police (Crime) Ashok Chand.
The extortionist posed himself as a gangster to threaten the Assistant Professor, said Chand.
The mobile phone and the SIM card used for threatening the Assistant Professor has been recovered, police said.
Ranjan hailed from Patna where he had worked in BPO, MNS Company. He came to Delhi in 2010 where he joined a bank as sales executive for six months. In 2012, he changed his job profile and started providing waiters for celebratory functions. In the year 2013, he was in deep financial crises and therefore he planned to extort money.
