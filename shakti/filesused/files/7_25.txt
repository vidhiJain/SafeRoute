A man, who allegedly trafficked minor girls from West Bengal and placed them as domestic servants in Delhi, has been arrested and 14 girls were rescued and sent back to their families, police said today.
According to the police, Raju alias Arju (30) was arrested from West Bengal by the Crime Branch of Delhi Police after months of efforts to nab him.
"Acting on a complaint, one Laxman, the owner of LG Placement Services, and his associate lady had been arrested for trafficking and placing minor girls as domestic servants in Delhi and NCR.
"During the course of investigation, it came to light that Raju was the main trafficker who used to bring minor girls from West Bengal and place them as domestic servants in Delhi and NCR," Additional Commissioner of Police (Crime) Ravindra Yadav said.
The ACP said Raju financially exploited these girls and their parents as the money taken as advance was never paid to the girls or their parents.
On receipt of a secret information about the presence of Raju at his native place in West Bengal, a police team was sent to Kolohazra village of 24 Parganas (South) district from where he was finally nabbed, police said.
After bringing him to Delhi, a total of 14 minor girls have so far been rescued on his instance.
"This is one of the largest rescue mission of girls by Crime Branch of the Delhi Police spanning over four months. All the 14 rescued girls have been safely escorted back to their homes," said Yadav.
