A 30-year-old man was allegedly beaten and flung to death from the third floor of a residential building after failing to pay Rs 180 to a restaurant owner, police said today.
The incident occurred late on Wednesday night at INA Market in south Delhi where the victim, identified as Deepak, had dinner at a restaurant with his relatives.
According to the brother of the victim the bill amounted to Rs.180 which he said he would pay later. He said the restaurant owner started beating up Deepak after that.
"They took my brother to our house and beat him up there as well. We intervened and paid the bill. Despite that, they continued to beat him. Then they took him to the third floor and flung him from the terrace," Ajay said.
Deepak, who was unemployed, was taken to All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) where doctors declared him dead.
Police said a case has been registered at Kotla Mubarakpur police station. They are verifying the family's allegations. They have also detained several people in this connection.
