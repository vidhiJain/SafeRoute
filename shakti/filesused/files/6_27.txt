A 54-year-old woman, working with the ministry of child development and women's affairs as an upper divisional clerk, was allegedly attacked in her Delhi home by a woman she previously employed as a domestic help, police said on Sunday.
A sharp-edged weapon was used in the attack, which occurred as the woman tried to resist an attempt at robbery by her former domestic servant, police said, adding that the accused was arrested. 
Kamaljeet Kaur was attacked in her house in north Delhi's Sector-3 Rohini area on Saturday evening. Her assailant was identified as Sunita. 
Kaur, who has been living alone since the death of her husband, told police that Sunita had been her domestic help about five years ago.
"Sunita had come to the victim's house Saturday evening, and discussed some work-related matters. She asked for some old clothes. When Kaur was busy looking through her clothes, Sunita tried to steal some valuables. The accused attacked Kaur's neck from behind with a sharp object when she resisted her stealing bid," a police officer, citing Kaur's statement, said.
Kaur raised an alarm and her neighbour Reeta rushed to help. The two pinned down Sunita, who was handed over to the police later, the officer said.
"Kaur was rushed to a nearby hospital where her condition is stated to be out of danger. The accused has been booked in an attempt to murder case," the officer said.
