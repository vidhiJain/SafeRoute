A 30-year-old saleswoman was allegedly raped by her employer on the first day of the job at an optical showroom in west Delhi's Paschim Vihar area in New Delhi, police said today.
Deepak Malhotra (61) who owns two optical showrooms in Paschim Vihar area, the same locality where he stays with his family, has been accused by the woman of offering her a spiked drink following which she fell unconscious and he allegedly raped her, police said.
Malhotra has been taken into custody for questioning and would be arrested if preliminary investigations confirm the allegations, they said.
In her complaint, the women claimed that Malhotra had selected her last week for the post of a saleswoman at his optical showroom in Jwalaheri centre, for which she had applied through a newspaper advertisement.
"The woman was called in for an interview on Monday following which Malhotra selected her for the position and asked her to report for work at 10 am on Tuesday," said a police official quoting the woman's statement.
When the woman reached office yesterday around 10.30 AM, she was called by Malhotra to his cabin on the pretext of briefing her about the job.
According to the police, Malhotra offered the woman spiked water and after consuming it she fell unconscious following which he allegedly raped her.
After gaining consciousness, the woman approached the police and informed them about her ordeal. She claimed that there was no one in the showroom at the time and the water was laced with sedatives.
A police team has recorded the woman's statement and sent her for medical examination. Further investigations are on in the matter, police added.
