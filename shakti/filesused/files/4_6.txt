A woman in Delhi was raped on Friday by a taxi driver who is now missing. Police sources say the man was a driver with Uber, the popular app that supplies taxis to users. 
The company issued a statement on Saturday night:
 
We became aware of the incident this morning. Safety is Uber's highest priority and we take situations like this very seriously. We are working with the police as they investigate, and will assist them in any way we can to determine what happened. It is also our policy to immediately suspend a driver's account following allegations of a serious incident, which we have done. In India, we work with licensed driver-partners to provide a safe transportation option, with layers of safeguards such as driver and vehicle information, and ETA-sharing to ensure there is accountability and traceability of all trips that occur on the Uber platform.
