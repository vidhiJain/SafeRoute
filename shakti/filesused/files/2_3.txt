The decomposed body of a 25- year-old man, who died under mysterious circumstances, was found inside his room in central Delhi's Patel Nagar area today.
The deceased, identified as Satish, worked for a courier company in Kirti Nagar and lived with his friend Kunal (24) in a rented accommodation. Both of them are natives of Jharkhand, a police official said.
On Saturday morning, Satish's maternal uncle, Vinod, who is a resident of west Delhi's Naraina, received a phone call from his roommate Kunal.
"He told Vinod over phone that he should come to their room immediately and disconnected the call. When Vinod called him back again, he couldn't be reached," a police official said.
A dedicated team was formed to track down Kunal for leads in the investigation, said an official.
On reaching Satish's residence, Vinod found the door locked and a stench coming out of it.
A police team had to then break the door down, and Satish's body was found in a decomposed state there, covered with a blanket.
However, no marks were spotted in his body, suggesting any kind of physical harm, police said.
"From preliminary investigation, it appears that Satish died two days ago but the cause of death could not be ascertained. The body will be sent for postmortem examination tomorrow after his family arrives," DCP (Central) Parmaditya said.
The police have also not ruled out the possibility of murder.
