A 35-year-old woman has alleged that she was sexually assaulted by three men in a moving car in south-east Delhi on Saturday.
The victim says she had hitched a ride with her sister to Delhi from Gurgaon on Saturday post midnight. Both sisters work at a shopping mall in the Delhi suburb.
While her sister got off at Okhla, the victim claims on the way to Sangam Vihar, where she was to be dropped, the men in the car sexually assaulted her.
A case was registered this morning when she went to the police.
