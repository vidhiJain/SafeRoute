One of Delhi's most dreaded criminals who ran extortion rackets targeting businessmen and was wanted in several cases of murder, was arrested on Tuesday, police said.
"We have arrested Neeraj Bawana early today (Tuesday) morning from Delhi," Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell) Sanjeev Yadav told IANS.
He was arrested around 3.45 am from west Delhi's Mundka area, following a tip-off.
A resident of west Delhi, Mr Bawana was wanted to stand trial in many cases of murder, extortion, attempt to murder, and other cases. He figured on the list of Delhi's 10 most wanted criminals compiled by Delhi Police.
Mr Yadav said the criminal ran extortion rackets in many parts of the city and the NCR.
His brother Rajesh Bawana was arrested in 2014, while his mother and other brothers were recently arrested from the Indira Gandhi International Airport while carrying illegal ammunition.
His gang had also played a role in the escape of Amit alias Bhura, who was reportedly freed from the custody of Uttarakhand Police while he was being taken to be presented before a Baghpat Court in December 2014.
