A three-year-old boy was rescued today from his kidnappers who also allegedly killed his mother on Saturday in Delhi. The boy's father, suspected of planning the murder and the kidnapping, has been detained. 
Sources said the kidnappers even tried to stab the policemen who had gone
 to rescue the boy from Uttarakhand today. A couple of cops have been 
reported to be injured in the scuffle, which could have been 
dangerous for the child too, police said.
According to the police, two men entered the Mayur Vihar apartment of the couple at around 12.30 pm on Saturday and strangled Mahi Sinha, 29, before taking her child hostage. Mahi was a former freelance journalist, her husband Inam runs a garment shop.
The domestic help in the house, the lone witness to the incident, told the police the killers threatened to kill the child too if she raised an alarm. Inam was at his garment shop when the incident happened, police said. 
The Delhi Police, investigating the case, suspect marital discord as the motive behind the crime. Sources say the father is likely to be arrested tomorrow.
