A woman, believed to be a citizen of Nepal, was allegedly gang-raped in the national capital by a group of three men on Wednesday night.
 
She was found in semi-naked and semi-conscious condition near the Nanakpura gurudwara in south Delhi around 7.20 a.m. on Thursday by a passerby, who then informed the Police Control Room.
 
The man who informed the police has told NDTV that when he found the woman, she was unable to speak much, but managed to convey to him and to the police that she was abducted on Wednesday night by three unknown men, who later drugged and raped her. He also said she scribbled three words on the road with a piece of red brick -"Nepal," "rape," and "Kotla Mubarakpur." 
 
The alleged victim, said to be a resident of the Kotla Mubarakpur area in south Delhi, has been taken to the Safdarjung Hospital for medical examination. Sources say she is married, is in her early 20s and works as a house help.
 
A case of rape has been registered. Sources in the police say they are waiting for the woman to regain consciousness to record her full statement.
