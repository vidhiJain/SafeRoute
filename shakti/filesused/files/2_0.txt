With the arrest of two persons, including a woman and recovery of marijuana worth around Rs 1 crore, the Crime Branch of Delhi Police today claimed to have busted an inter-state drug module.
The accused, Rahul (22) and the 29-year-old woman, whose name was not disclosed, were arrested from near Anand Vihar ISBT, where they had come to meet an associate, said police.
"The duo had arrived there in a car and a marijuana consignment weighing around 1 Kg was concealed inside. The consignment was procured from Odisha," said Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) Ravindra Yadav.
They turned out to be delivery persons working for the module and earned around Rs 10,000 for each delivery, said Mr Yadav.
During interrogation, they told police that they were working for an alleged drug trafficker, Manjeet, who is presently lodged in Tihar jail.
Manjeet's associate at Odisha, identified as Mama, is presently heading the module, procuring marijuana from Lamtaput and other naxalite areas in Odisha, said a police officer.
In a separate incident, a Police Control Room team patrolling at outer Delhi's Mongolpuri area recovered around 6.20 kg marijuana from the possession of a youth, police said today.
The accused, identified as Santosh (20), tried to flee on seeing the PCR van. He was arrested after a brief chase, said Additional Commissioner of Police (Operations).
