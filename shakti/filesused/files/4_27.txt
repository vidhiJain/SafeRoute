Three businessmen have been found dead in a Honda City parked in South Delhi's RK Puram neighbourhood.
 
The police says the trio were between 25 and 35 years old and their bodies were discovered, frothing at the mouth, at 11 pm on Monday night in a car whose windows were rolled down. 
 
"We have got to know that they were chatting inside the car with the AC on and eating some snacks. As per initial investigation, they might have died due to gas poisoning or consumption of poisonous substance as no injury marks have been found on their bodies," said an unnamed police officer to the Press Trust of India.
 
The police has accessed CCTV footage from cameras installed in the vicinity. A team of forensics experts has sifted through the car for finger prints and other evidence.
 
The families of the dead men say that they were murdered - Lakhvinder Singh, brother of Balvinder, who was the owner of the car, told NDTV, "The seat next to the driver was empty and that a fourth man who was present must be tracked down."
