Delhi Police today suggested to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government to build up enough creches for working mothers and make value education compulsory in schools and colleges, in the wake of the two recent cases of rape with minors.
In his letter to Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, Police Commissioner BS Bassi said that the number of working women in the city should be assessed and creches (day-care homes) should be built for their children accordingly.
Referring to the incident in east Delhi's Anand Vihar, where a five-year-old girl, whose parents were out working, was allegedly raped by three men, the police commissioner said, there are thousands of such mothers - mostly the ones employed in the unorganised sector - who have to leave their children at homes in the absence of adequate day-care facilities.
"I also suggested that moral education and value education should immediately be introduced for boys in schools and colleges as compulsory subjects," Mr Bassi said, adding, schools should also look for "deviant behaviour" among children and provide for a "system" to "ensure" that they are corrected through counselling by psychologists.
The police chief further said that the government should also assess school dropouts and provide for their rehabilitation.
Mr Bassi sent the letter to Mr Sisodia this morning. Copies of the letter were also marked to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung.
Attributing the increase in the crime rate in Delhi to "truthful registration" of cases, the commissioner claimed that incidents of crime are "not increasing", it is the "registration of crime which has increased".
He added that police needs help of civil society and the state government to fight crime.
