A 25-year-old woman was allegedly beaten to death by her husband with a baseball bat after an argument ensued between them over the latter's drinking habit.
The incident took place in east Delhi's Mayur Vihar area around 8 PM last night when the accused identified as Vinod Kumar (30) returned to the couple's rented accommodation in an inebriated state.
"When his wife, identified as Priya confronted her over his regular drinking habit, an argument ensued between the couple and Kumar attacked his wife with a baseball bat and hit her repeatedly. As she collapsed in a pool of blood, he fled the scene," said a police official.
Hearing the commotion, the couple's land lady Zubeida Begum sent her son to check what was wrong around 9 PM. When he reached the spot, he found Priya lying on the floor in a pool of blood while Vinod had fled the scene.
Police was informed and Priya was rushed to a nearby hospital where she was declared brought dead.
Neighbours told police that Vinod worked at odd jobs to earn his livelihood and there used to be frequent quarrels among the couple over his drinking habit. A case of murder was registered at Mayur Vihar Police Station and manhunt was launched to nab the accused. He was arrested by the police today afternoon.
