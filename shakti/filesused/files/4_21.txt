Delhi Police might soon get 10,000 more closed-circuit TV (CCTV) cameras to keep a close watch on street crime across the sprawling capital.
According to informed sources, the police had requested the home ministry for 10,000 more CCTV cameras to be installed on roads. They are likely to get the approval soon. The CCTV cameras will help the police in not only averting crimes on roads but collect evidence and quickly nab the culprits.
Delhi, with a population of over 16 million and growing, has close to 22,000 CCTV cameras installed all around the city.
"CCTV cameras are of immense help. Of the total cameras, Delhi Police have installed 3,586 cameras, whereas 17,303 have been installed by the members of the public," the sources told IANS.
"Civic agencies have also installed 992 cameras," the source added.
Police said there has been many a case where they have been able to nab the culprits with the help of the CCTV cameras.
One such instance was when Delhi Police was able to identify five accused who had stabbed a man to death in south Delhi with the help of the CCTV cameras.
The horrific way the murder took place on the Delhi road was also flashed on all major television channels.
Police said though there are no guidelines for installing the CCTV cameras that can record live videos and record footage up to 20 days, they have asked members of the public to install these cameras for their own safety on many an occasion.
"We have installed cameras at many places. But at crowded market locations, we ask shopkeepers to install them outside their shops," a police officer told IANS.
"Mall owners and hotels are also advised to install them," the officer told IANS.
District-wise figures obtained by IANS reveal that Outer Delhi has the highest number of cameras: 4,529 by the public, 246 by Delhi Police and 186 by civic agencies.
The reason: More malls and shopping arcades and also more of street crime.
The New Delhi area, home to the VVIPs like the president, prime minister, ministers, the diplomatic community and the large number of bureaucrats - has a minimum number of public-installed CCTV cameras.
