A man has been arrested for allegedly killing a 73-year-old central Delhi-based property dealer to whom he owed some money, police said on Wednesday.
Sanjay, 34, a resident of east Delhi's Geeta Colony, was arrested early on Wednesday.
Sanjay allegedly killed Naresh Kumar Bansal and dumped his body near Shanti Van. The body was recovered by a police patrol around 1 a.m. on Tuesday from Daryaganj.
Bansal, who stayed in east Delhi's Laxmi Nagar area and ran a property related business from Chandni Chowk in central Delhi, had come to Daryaganj on Monday evening with his son and approached the accused.
Sanjay told interrogators that he had borrowed some money from Bansal and he was unable to repay it.
"Frustrated by the persuasion of the victim for the borrowed money, Sanjay hatched a plan to kill him about a month back. He along with his associate took the victim to a secluded place in Kashmere Gate in his car on the pretext of paying the borrowed money," said the official.
"Sanjay gruesomely strangulated victim's neck with a clutch wire and then slashed his neck with a sharp cutter," the official said.
According to police, Sanjay worked in a family transport business in Chandni Chowk and has no previous criminal record.
