Just two days after the investigation into the death of union minister Shashi Tharoor's wife 
 was transferred to the Crime Branch of the Delhi Police, in a surprise move on Friday, the probe was transferred back to the South district Police.
Top sources in the police said the case was transferred back to the South district Police to ensure continuity in the investigation. However, senior police officials did not answer why the case was handed over to the crime branch in the first place if the Delhi Police wanted to ensure continuity in the probe.
The Crime Branch was asked on Thursday to handle the probe given the "sensitive nature" and "complexities" involved.
Earlier on Friday, Mrs Tharoor's brother, Captain Rajesh Pushkar, came out in strong defence of Mr Tharoor, saying it was "unimaginable" that he could harm Mrs Tharoor and sought an end to the rumours that were hurting the family.
In a statement, Mr Pushkar said his sister was one of the strongest personalities and to even remotely think that she would do any bodily harm to herself is "preposterous" and "should not be believed".
Mrs Tharoor, 52, was found dead last week in a five-star hotel in Delhi, days after she said she had uncovered evidence of her husband's affair with a Pakistani journalist who she targeted with a litany of tweets. However, the Tharoors then released a statement saying they were happily married.
An autopsy report found that she died of poisoning. Doctors who handled her post-mortem described her death as "sudden and unnatural" and said that though she had injuries on the upper half of her body, they were not the cause of her death.
