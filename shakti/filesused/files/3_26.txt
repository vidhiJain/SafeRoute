Two men on a motorcycle threw acid on a woman doctor today in West Delhi's Rajouri Garden. The attack has been caught on CCTV cameras installed in the market.
The woman in her statement to the police said that she did not know the men or suspect anyone. In fact she also said she is surprised that anyone would want to attack her. The police are analysing the footage to identify the accused.
Half of the woman's face is burnt, and she is being treated at the premier All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).
According to the police, the woman was on her way to the hospital where she works when the bike-borne men overtook her scooter near the market in Rajouri Garden, threw acid on her and fled. The woman lives in Hari Nagar in West Delhi.
The woman shouted for help, but no one in the busy market place came to her rescue, according to the police who were later informed about the incident by a local resident.
Aam Aadmi Party leader and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted:
Rising number of acid attacks in India led the Supreme Court to issue guidelines last year to restrict its sale.
There have been over 200 reported cases of such attacks on women between 2010 and 2012, according to the National Crime Records Bureau.
