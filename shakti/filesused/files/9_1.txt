Irked at an MLA for not taking his phone calls, a drunken man today "fired" with a toy pistol outside the Delhi legislator's office in New Delhi today triggering panic in the area.
Ravinder Yadav, who was allegedly under the influence of alcohol, was upset at Congress MLA, Anil Bharadwaj, from Trinagar constituency for not picking up his calls and he used a toy pistol to "open fire" in front of his office in Chanderlok area, Delhi Police spokesperson Rajan Bhagat said.
Mr Yadav has been arrested and a case registered against him, he said.
The cartridge used in the toy pistol was recovered outside Mr Bharadwaj's office, Mr Bhagat said.
"The MLA was not in the office when the incident took place," he said, adding it had come to light during investigations that the accused used a toy pistol, which posed no danger to any person.
The incident created a furore in the Delhi Assembly with Sheila Dikshit's Parliamentary Secretary Mukesh Sharma raising the matter.
All the Congress MLAs were on their feet soon after the issue was raised and amid pandemonium, the House was adjourned.
In the House, Sheila Dikshit said the security is a "major issue".
She also said the Police Commissioner should come to the House and explain the situation in the city.
A senior police official said Mr Yadav was apprehended by Sub Inspector Lalit Kumar, who is posted in Bhalswa Dairy police station.
"Kumar was passing by the area with his wife to meet a doctor when the incident took place. He showed exemplary courage, took it as call of duty and caught the accused," the official said.
