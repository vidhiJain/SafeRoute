The decomposed bodies of a 30-year-old woman and her seven-year-old son were found from their house in Delhi on Sunday, police said.
The bodies of Sommati and Kamal were recovered from their first floor flat in Govindpuri area of south Delhi around 4 pm, after police broke into the house after neighbours complained of a foul smell emanating from there, said a police official.
The official said that it was very difficult to say how the victims were killed because the bodies were in highly decomposed condition.
"We are looking for Sommati's husband Rohit who is missing from his house for two-three days," said the official.
Rohit, who deals in computer related items, might be the culprit, said the official.
