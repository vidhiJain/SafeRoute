Railways have taken several steps to ensure security of women passengers, a senior Railway Ministry official said.
Currently, 1,275 trains are being escorted by Railway Protection Force (RPF) daily on an average in addition to 2,220 trains escorted by Government Railway Police (GRP).
Ladies special trains are being escorted by lady RPF staff, wherever available in suburban sections also.
Security helpline numbers have been set up in the zonal control rooms over some zonal railways to facilitate the passengers to inform about any untoward incident, the official said.
The numbers of such security helplines have been displayed at prominent places of stations and in the coaches.
Regular drives are also conducted to prevent entry of male passengers in ladies compartments and if found, they are prosecuted under the provisions of the Railways Act, he said.
