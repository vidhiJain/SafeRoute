Three men who gang-raped a 19-year-old girl in Delhi in February 2012, poured acid on her and later gouged out her eyes with a screwdriver have been sentenced to death by a city court. 
The teenager's mutilated and decomposed body was found in a village in Haryana three days after she was kidnapped on her way home from her office in Gurgaon. Her body also bore cigarette burn marks. 
According to the prosecution, the convicts repeatedly raped and brutalized her for three days before she died. Two of the convicts were brothers. The prosecution said they had planned revenge on the girl, who had rejected their advances.
The Delhi Police had asked for the death sentence for the rapists saying their crime was in the rarest of rare category. The prosecution also told the court that the convicts had not shown any remorse during the trial. The trio was convicted on Thursday.
The girl, who worked as a data entry operator in Gurgaon, was kidnapped by the three men near her house in Qutub Vihar area of Delhi. She was allegedly raped and tortured till she died on February 9, 2012.
