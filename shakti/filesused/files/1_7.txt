Stating that the Juvenile Justice Bill was "rushed through" in the Rajya Sabha without thinking on ways to fight crime in detail, CPI(M) today said that Parliament missed an opportunity to consider the "important" bill in a more "dispassionate and scientific" manner.
CPI(M) chief Sitaram Yechury also questioned the Government why recommendations made by Justice JS Verma committee on women safety were allegedly ignored in the bill and expressed disappointment that the bill was not sent to select committee for a detailed study.
In a series of tweets, Mr Yechury said, "Verma Cmtee & Standing Cmtee opposed this lowering of age. Need to think about how we treat our young persons & how crime should be fought. Fighting juvenile crime has had to be thought through. Bill should have been sent to the Select Committe. Pity it was rushed through."
He added, "The Justice JS Verma Committee had so much more to offer for women's safety. Why are those recommendations being ignored? Regret that the Parliament has missed an opportunity to consider such an important bill in a more dispassionate and scientific manner."
Juveniles aged 16 years and above will now be tried under laws for adults for heinous crimes as Parliament today passed a much-expected bill in this regard against the backdrop of a juvenile convict being released in the gang-rape and murder case of 23-year-old Jyoti Singh in December 2012.
The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Bill, which provides for lowering the age for trial from 18 years, was passed by Rajya Sabha with a voice vote after a walkout by Left parties which wanted it to be sent to a Select Committee. The bill was passed by Lok Sabha earlier.
