A mango vendor battered a boy to death for stealing a fruit from his pushcart murder triggering tension in a New Delhi locality, police said on Friday. 
A large contingent of police was deployed in Seemapuri in east Delhi following the incident on Thursday night.
Police said the 15 year-oldÂ  boy was attacked with an iron rod, which was used by the accused for lighting a battery operated tubelight.
He was immediately rushed to a hospital where doctors pronounced him dead on arrival.
Eyewitnesses said the boy had stopped near the vendor's push cart and showed him a Rs10 note while demanding that he be given the fruit.
'But, as the boy was not giving the note but kept on asking for the mango, the vendor refused to comply ...the boy picked up a mango and kept it in his pocket. This enraged the accused who beat the boy to death," said a police official.
The accused is on the run after the incident.
