A businessman and his two employees were arrested for making extortion calls to another businessman after claiming to be members of wanted terrorist Dawood Ibrahim's gang, police said on Thursday.
Sameer, 30, and his two employees were arrested from north Delhi's Shakurbasti area after they made extortion calls to Bhavesh Yadav Thursday morning, police said.
On Wednesday, the callers had made several calls to Yadav and demanded Rs.2 crore within a week. They also identified themselves as members of "D company", a term coined to describe an international organised crime group controlled by Dawood Ibrahim.
Police said the accused businessman, known to the victim, resorted to the stratagem to overcome losses he had incurred in his business.
