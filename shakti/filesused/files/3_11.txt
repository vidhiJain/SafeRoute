Prime Minister Narendra Modi today ordered strong action against "rising crime and vandalism in Delhi" after a break-in at a convent school in Vasant Vihar in the city's south.
The incident at the Holy Child Auxilium School last night comes after a series of cases of vandalism at churches, which have been described as thefts by the police, an explanation dismissed by the opposition and Christian community leaders.
