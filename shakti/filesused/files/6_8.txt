A 25-year-old man was stabbed to death by a friend with whom he was engaged in a gambling game on Diwali night in the national capital.
The two argued over Rs 180, and that led to the stabbing incident, police said on Monday.
Govind, the victim, suffered fatal wounds as his friend Pawan stabbed him at Sarai Rohilla in north Delhi. 
Govind was rushed to hospital, where he succumbed to his wounds. Police said Pawan was arrested from the spot.
