A woman has been found murdered and violated with a stick in Delhi's Vasant Kunj, in a chilling reminder of the December 2012 gangrape case in Delhi. 
The body of the woman, with her hands and legs tied, was found in a closed government nursery on Saturday morning. The police suspect she had been gangraped before being killed. The postmortem report is awaited.
A security guard at the nursery informed the police around 8 am after the body was discovered. A case of murder has been registered.
"She seems to have been strangulated with a scarf she was wearing," said Prem Nath, Deputy Commissioner of Police, South.
The woman, who was around 40 years old and a mother of three, was the only earning member of her family. Her husband, who used to work as a security guard, had met with an accident last March. Two months ago, she had got a job in a factory, where she did embroidery work.
She has three daughters, aged between 15 and 9.
On Friday, she had left for work around 9:30 am. But when she did not return till late evening, her family informed the police.
Police have detained three workers from the factory for questioning. They are also looking for the man who often escorted her home when she finished work late.
Her daughters said she had been escorted by the man on Thursday too, when she had reached home around 10 pm. The girls also said their mother had an argument with the factory's head tailor, but did not know what the argument was about.
On Friday, when she did not return by 10 pm, they went to the factory with their father looking for her. When they were told the factory had been shut for the night, the family approached the police.
